### 🛠 **Implementation: Speech-to-Text Pipeline**  
*Radio Ergo Somali Speech-to-Text for Food Security.ipynb*  

This Jupyter Notebook implements a pipeline to:  
✅ Download broadcasts from **Radio Ergo’s SoundCloud channel**  
✅ Transcribe them using **Whisper** and a **fine-tuned Whisper model for Somali language**
